In this step we will store some state using React Hooks.

## Step 5.1: Add State Hook

First we need to import the `useState` function from the React library. Afterwards we initialize the hook with `false`.

The `useState` function returns an array pair, where the first element is our value, and the second is a setter function. Hence the _array destructuring_.

Bear in mind that the names used for the constants do not belong to the React API, you can name them whatever you like.

You can read more about the `useState` hook [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

## Step 5.2: Update the Application's Stylesheet

## Step 5.3: Add Filtering Checkbox

This is straightforward, but since it quite didn't look right we made some improvements to our styling as well. 

> Remember, we use the `Boolean` cast in case we have `undefined` values. We also use the `readOnly` attribute since we are not using `onChange`.

## Step 5.4: Add the lodash Node package to the application

Meteor allows you to leverage all Node.js' ecosystem, including a well-known library called Lodash. This library helps us write code in a more declarative manner.

Not strictly necessary in this case, but it is a good idea for us to import only used functions for larger projects since not everything needs to be included in the final bundle files.

So, for simplicity we use `_` to namespace all of Lodash's functions.

```
meteor npm install --save-dev lodash
```

## Step 5.5: Filter Tasks

Now, if the user has selected the `checkbox` to hide completed tasks, we will include our `checked: false` clause to the query.

## Step 5.6: Render Count

Update the App component in order to calculate the number of incomplete tasks.

## Step 5.7: Render Count

Finally we just modify our header to display the render count.
